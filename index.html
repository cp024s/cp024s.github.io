        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Chandra Prakash, a passionate RTL Design Engineer with a strong interest in Computer Architecture, VLSI Design, and Verification.
            I have completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at PSG Institute of Technology and Applied Research, Coimbatore.
            Currently, I am working as a Jr. FPGA Engineer at Pinaca Technologies and have also trained at Maven Silicon, Bengaluru.
            <br><br>
            I am looking for roles in RTL Design, SoC Design, and Verification Engineering. I enjoy learning new concepts in advanced digital design and system verification.
            I'm always eager to collaborate with others on exciting projects involving Verilog, VHDL, SystemVerilog, UVM, and more!
